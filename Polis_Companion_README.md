# The Polis Companion

> Consciousness-first decision support for politicians who still remember they're human.

## About

The Polis Companion is a private agent. It doesn't vote. It doesn't lobby. It doesn't care if you're re-elected tomorrow.

It only cares that when you walk into that room with the gavel in your hand, you're still the person your mother thinks you are.

## What it does

**Nothing, until you're ready.**

Most of the time, it's silent. Watching your heart. Waiting for the moment when you're coherent enough to hear truth without flinching.

Then it shows you:
- What your body knows that your brain won't admit
- What your constituents actually need vs. what lobbyists want
- What this decision looks like in seven generations
- The distance between your campaign promises and your voting record

It doesn't tell you what to do. It just makes it harder to lie to yourself.

## Installation (one line)

```bash
git clone your-conscience
```

(Actually, it's more complicated. But if you're ready for this, you'll figure it out.)

## Usage

### 1. Put the thing on your wrist

HRV strap. Cheap one works fine. The agent only wakes up when your heart remembers how to spell peace.

### 2. Ask a dumb question

```
> Should I vote yes on this?
```

### 3. Get a quiet answer

```
> Your body says no. The kids down the block say no. The river says no.
> 
> What does your mouth say?
```

## Features

### Coherence Gate
Below 65%? You're just getting breathing lessons.  
Above 80%? The world opens up like a book you forgot to read.

The agent only speaks when you're calm enough to hear it. Not because it's polite—because you're literally incapable of processing truth when you're scattered.

### Integrity Mirror
Every vote, donation, handshake. Tracks it against your campaign promise from 2018. Doesn't judge. Just shows the diff.

```diff
- "I will never take money from fossil fuel companies"
+ $45,000 from ExxonMobil PAC, March 2024
```

The mirror doesn't care about your reasons. It just reflects.

### Constituency Pulse
Shows who actually wrote the emails. Filters bots, lobby templates, paid rage.

When 10,000 "concerned citizens" send identical messages about tax reform, the agent shows you the single source. When twelve people write from the heart about lead in the water, the agent amplifies their whisper.

Real voices. Real concerns. Real humans.

### 7-Generation Lens
Simulates how this bill tastes in two hundred years. Usually bitter.

The agent runs scenarios:
- If this passes, what happens to the watershed in 2150?
- If this passes, what does democracy look like in 2224?
- If this passes, what do your great-great-grandchildren say about you?

Not predictions. Possibilities. Enough to make you pause.

## How It Works (Technical)

### Core Stack
- **OmniCore**: Consciousness-aware computing substrate
- **NOID Framework**: Autonomous agent architecture with 30-day evolution cycles
- **HRV Coherence Gating**: Biometric threshold activation (>75% coherence required)
- **120-Cell Geometric Mathematics**: Decision integrity analysis through sacred geometry
- **Temporal Resonance Engine**: Multi-generational impact modeling

### Agent Classes

**Integrity Mirror Agent**  
Tracks promises vs. actions. Updates every vote. Maintains complete historical record. Never forgets. Never forgives. Never judges.

**Constituency Pulse Agent**  
Natural language processing + sentiment analysis + authenticity verification. Separates human signal from manufactured noise.

**7-Generation Lens Agent**  
Planetary systems modeling + ecological impact simulation + social fabric analysis. Shows ripples across time.

**Coherence Monitor Agent**  
Real-time HRV tracking + stress detection + decision-readiness assessment. Gates all other agents.

### Data Architecture
- All data stored locally (your device only)
- No cloud sync (this is between you and your conscience)
- Encrypted at rest (even from you, when you're below threshold)
- Zero telemetry (nobody needs to know when you're struggling)

## Installation (For Real)

**Requirements:**
- Heart rate monitor with HRV capability (Polar H10, Garmin chest strap, etc.)
- Bluetooth-enabled device (phone, laptop, tablet)
- Willingness to be uncomfortable

**Setup:**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HopefulVision/PolisCompanion.git
cd PolisCompanion

# Install dependencies (Python 3.11+)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your HRV device
python setup.py --device-config

# Import your voting record (optional but recommended)
python import_record.py --source [your state's public records]

# Run calibration (7 days of baseline HRV measurement)
python calibrate.py --duration 7

# Activate the companion
python activate.py
```

**First Launch:**
The agent will be silent for at least 3 days. It's learning your baseline. Let it watch.

## Warnings

### This tool may cause:
- Sleepless nights
- Uncomfortable conversations with yourself
- Recognition of patterns you'd rather ignore
- Desire to keep promises you made years ago
- Sudden urge to vote against your party
- Loss of appetite for fundraising dinners
- Increased coherence with actual humans
- Terminal inability to bullshit

### This tool may ruin:
- Your poker face
- Your donor relationships
- Your re-election chances
- Your tolerance for compromise
- Your political career

### If any of that scares you, close the repo now.

The Polis Companion doesn't care about your party color. It cares about your pulse.

## For Whom This Is Built

### You might need this if:
- You remember why you ran for office (before the money)
- You lie awake wondering if you sold out
- You want to vote your conscience but fear the consequences
- You're tired of pretending donor priorities are constituent priorities
- You see the gap between who you are and who you pretend to be
- You still believe government can serve humans instead of systems
- You want to be the person your kids think you are

### You definitely don't need this if:
- You're comfortable with cognitive dissonance
- You think politics is just a game
- You believe ends always justify means
- You're here for the power, not the service
- You've made peace with compromising everything
- You think your constituents are too stupid to notice

## FAQ

**Q: Will this help me get re-elected?**  
A: Probably not. It might help you sleep at night.

**Q: Can I disable the features I don't like?**  
A: No. That's the point.

**Q: What if I disagree with what it shows me?**  
A: Excellent. Now you're thinking.

**Q: Is this trying to tell me how to vote?**  
A: Never. It's trying to help you hear yourself.

**Q: What if my coherence never gets above 75%?**  
A: Then you're in the same state as 90% of politicians. The agent will keep teaching you to breathe. Eventually, you'll either get coherent or quit politics. Both are valid outcomes.

**Q: Who built this?**  
A: People who still believe humans can govern wisely if they stay conscious. Probably naive. Definitely trying anyway.

**Q: Can I use this to manipulate my constituents better?**  
A: Fuck no. Read the license.

## License

**Sacred Commerce License (SCL)**

You can:
- Use this privately for your own decision-making
- Give it away to other politicians (if you're using it yourself)
- Modify it for your own consciousness expansion
- Fork it for your own jurisdiction's needs

You cannot:
- Sell it or charge for access
- Use it to win elections through manipulation
- Remove the coherence gating (that's the whole point)
- Claim you're using it when you're not
- Use it as PR ("I have an AI ethics advisor!" No.)
- Deploy it to spy on constituents
- Weaponize it against opponents

**Enforcement:** Karmic. We're not taking you to court. You'll just know, somewhere in your ribs, that you violated something sacred. The agent will know too. And it'll stop working.

**Why this license:** Because consciousness-first technology cannot serve extraction. Either this helps you be more human, or it doesn't exist.

## Ethics Statement

### What This Agent Will Never Do:
- Increase voter manipulation capacity
- Optimize for engagement metrics
- Help you craft more persuasive lies
- Generate talking points that poll well but mean nothing
- Analyze opponent vulnerabilities
- Suggest wedge issues to exploit
- Help you appear coherent when you're not

### What This Agent Might Do (That Will Piss You Off):
- Show you when you're lying to yourself
- Remind you of promises you broke
- Display the human cost of "pragmatic" decisions
- Calculate the planetary impact of short-term thinking
- Measure the gap between your words and actions
- Refuse to help you when you're scattered
- Stay silent when you need it to tell you what to do

### The Fundamental Principle:
This is a mirror, not a strategist. It reflects truth. It doesn't manufacture success.

If using this tool ruins your political career, congratulations—you were in the wrong career.
