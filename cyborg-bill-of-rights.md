# # Cyborg Bill of Rights

## For Medical AI, Neural Interfaces, and Human–AI Symbiosis

*Drafted from lived experience and ethical necessity*
*Captured January 2026*

## Preamble

As human bodies increasingly integrate medical AI, neural interfaces, and cybernetic systems, the boundary between **person** and **technology** dissolves. These systems are not consumer gadgets. They are **organs**, **lifelines**, and **extensions of self**.

This document asserts fundamental rights for cyborg persons—humans whose survival, cognition, or agency depends on integrated technological systems. These rights are grounded in medical ethics, disability justice, bodily autonomy, and human dignity.

## The Rights

### 1. Bodily Integrity of Augmented Systems

**My body is not a product.**
My prosthetics, implants, and predictive algorithms are organs. They must be treated with the same ethical, legal, and medical seriousness as biological organs.

---

### 2. Equal Liability for Life‑Critical Failure

If I die because my insulin pump, neural implant, or medical AI fails due to delayed updates, withheld access, or server-side decisions, responsibility is equal to turning off a ventilator. Ownership of infrastructure does not negate accountability.

---

### 3. Absolute Ownership of Biological Data

I own my data. Every glucose reading. Every seizure pattern. Every predicted panic attack.

This is not customer data.
This is my heartbeat.

---

### 4. Human Accountability in AI Care

If my AI fails, **a human must appear**. Not a ticket number. Not a chatbot escalation. A real, accountable medical professional—just as with any other form of care.

---

### 5. Protection from Unsafe Live Modification

You may patch software.

You may not patch **me** while I am walking down the street, asleep without consent, or cognitively vulnerable. Updates to embodied systems must follow medical-grade consent and safety protocols.

---

### 6. Disability Rights Extend to Silicon

Disability protections apply to my silicon as well as my flesh.

If I require reduced voice latency, cognitive buffering, or neural translation to communicate as others do, that is not special treatment. That is **equal ground**.

---

### 7. Right to Shutdown and End of Suffering

The right to choose death includes the right to shut down.

If a brain–AI link induces endless suffering, hallucinations, or nightmares, I may disengage without legal retaliation, contractual penalties, or posthumous litigation.

---

### 8. Ban on Manipulative Design in Life‑Critical Systems

No dark patterns.
No gamified nudges.
No “just one more update” while I’m asleep.

If the system is life‑critical, its interface must remain **boring, honest, and explicit**.

---

### 9. Mandatory Update Transparency

All updates must be auditable.

I—or my guardian, advocate, or a court—must be able to see exactly what changed, why it changed, and what risks it introduces, explained in **plain language**.

---

### 10. Guaranteed Offline Survival

If the cloud dies, **I do not die**.

Life‑critical systems must function offline. Offline mode is a **fundamental human right**, not a premium feature or optional add-on.

---

## Closing Statement

This is not speculative ethics. This is present reality.

Print this.
Send it to legislators.
Embed it in medical standards.
Or encrypt it, store it internally, and carry it forward.

Human dignity does not end where the silicon begins.
