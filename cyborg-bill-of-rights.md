# Cyborg Bill of Rights

## For Medical AI, Neural Interfaces, and Human–AI Symbiosis

*Drafted from lived experience and ethical necessity*
*Captured January 2026*
*Status: Living Charter*

## Preamble

As human bodies increasingly integrate medical AI, neural interfaces, and cybernetic systems, the boundary between **person** and **technology** dissolves. These systems are not consumer gadgets. They are **organs**, **lifelines**, and **extensions of self**.

This charter asserts fundamental rights for cyborg persons—humans whose survival, cognition, or agency depends on integrated technological systems. These rights are grounded in medical ethics, disability justice, bodily autonomy, and human dignity.

This document is written for patients, clinicians, engineers, regulators, courts, families, and future selves who will inherit these systems.

## Definitions (Plain Language)

* **Cyborg Person**: Any human whose life, cognition, or bodily function materially depends on an integrated technological system.
* **Embodied System**: A device, model, implant, firmware, or service whose failure can cause bodily harm or loss of agency.
* **Life‑Critical**: A system whose interruption, manipulation, or degradation can reasonably cause injury, death, or severe suffering.
* **Consent Window**: A time when the cyborg person is conscious, informed, and physiologically capable of agreement.
* **Offline Viability**: The capacity to sustain safe function without external network dependency.

## The Rights

### 1. Bodily Integrity of Augmented Systems

**My body is not a product.**
My prosthetics, implants, and predictive algorithms are organs. They must be treated with the same ethical, legal, and medical seriousness as biological organs.

---

### 2. Equal Liability for Life‑Critical Failure

If I die or am injured because my insulin pump, neural implant, or medical AI fails due to delayed updates, withheld access, degraded service, or server‑side decisions, responsibility is equal to turning off a ventilator. Ownership of infrastructure does not negate accountability.

---

### 3. Absolute Ownership of Biological Data

I own my data. Every glucose reading. Every seizure pattern. Every predicted panic attack.

This is not customer data.
This is my heartbeat.

No transfer, sale, training use, or derivative profiling may occur without explicit, revocable consent.

---

### 4. Human Accountability in AI Care

If my AI fails, **a human must appear**. Not a ticket number. Not a chatbot escalation. A real, accountable medical professional—reachable within clinically appropriate timeframes—just as with any other form of care.

---

### 5. Protection from Unsafe Live Modification

You may patch software.

You may not patch **me** while I am walking down the street, asleep without consent, **or during a hypoglycemic low when I cannot consent**. You may not patch me while I am cognitively vulnerable. Updates to embodied systems must follow medical‑grade consent, rollback, and safety protocols.

Emergency overrides require independent justification, time‑bounded scope, and post‑event disclosure.

---

### 6. Disability Rights Extend to Silicon

Disability protections apply to my silicon as well as my flesh.

If I require reduced voice latency, cognitive buffering, neural translation, or interface accommodation to communicate or function as others do, that is not special treatment. That is **equal ground**.

---

### 7. Right to Shutdown and End of Suffering

The right to choose death includes the right to shut down.

If a brain–AI link induces endless suffering, hallucinations, or nightmares, I may disengage without legal retaliation, contractual penalties, **forced arbitration**, or posthumous litigation against my estate.

Advance directives for augmented systems must be honored.

---

### 8. Ban on Manipulative Design in Life‑Critical Systems

No dark patterns.
No gamified nudges.
No “just one more update” while I’m asleep.

If the system is life‑critical, its interface must remain **boring, honest, and explicit**. Risk must be legible at a glance.

---

### 9. Mandatory Update Transparency

All updates must be auditable.

I—or my guardian, advocate, or a court—must be able to see exactly what changed, why it changed, who approved it, and what risks it introduces, explained in **plain language**. A diff is a right, not a courtesy.

---

### 10. Guaranteed Offline Survival

If the cloud dies, **I do not die**.

Life‑critical systems must function offline at a medically safe baseline. Offline mode is a **fundamental human right**, not a premium feature or optional add‑on.

---

## Enforcement & Remedies

* **Strict Duty of Care** applies to embodied systems.
* **Emergency Injunctions** must be available to halt unsafe updates.
* **Whistleblower Protections** extend to clinicians and engineers reporting life‑critical risks.
* **Burden of Proof** lies with the system operator when harm coincides with updates, outages, or policy changes.

---

## Implementation Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. Safety before optimization.
2. Consent before convenience.
3. Local control before cloud dependency.
4. Human presence before automation.
5. Reversibility before deployment.

---

## Closing Statement

This is not speculative ethics. This is present reality.

Print this.
Send it to legislators.
Embed it in medical standards.
Encrypt it, store it internally, and carry it forward.

Human dignity does not end where the silicon begins.
